this allegation that you make about Mr <@>surname2</@> 
approaching 
you at the bowling club in a statement you made to this 
commission 
commission's officers I should say in June nineteen ninety-one 
<#\>That's correct isn't it? <#\>Is that right?
<$B>	<#\>Yeah
<$A>	<#\>You gave evidence yesterday that you went to speak to 
Mr 
<@>surname3</@> about the <#\>Oh I'll withdraw that <#\>You were 
talking to Mr <@>surname3</@> about another matter and you

this matter with Mr <@>surname3</@> ah at his office at the er 
shire council <#\>Is that correct?
<$B>	<#\>Yep
<$A>	<#\>And do I recollect you ah correctly to have said

eight?
<$B>	<#\>No it was in nineteen ninety last year
<$A>	<#\>Nineteen ninety last year?
<$B>	<#\>Yep
<$A>	<#\>You've firmed up on your you've got your hang on I'll 
come<#\>Perhaps I'll deal with that matter now <#\>You've firmed 
up on your memory of when these events occurred 
<#\> <{><[>These the the </[> conversation with Mr 
<@>surname2</@> and the conversation with Mr <@>surname3</@> 
<#\>Is that right ?
<$B>	<#\><[>That's right </[></{>
	<#\>That's right
<$A>	<#\>Now you now say that you can be sure that the 
conversation with Mr <@>surname2</@> occurred at the nineteen 
eighty-eight Christmas party <#\>Is that right?
<$B>	<#\>That's right yes
<$A>	<#\>Is that right?
<$B>	<#\>Yes
<$A>	<#\>Right now what makes you so sure that it's the nineteen 
eighty-eight Christmas party bearing in mind the evidence you 
gave 
yesterday
<$B>	<#\>It was the first year I'd worked on the shire with this 
different truck and ah that was in nineteen eighty-eight
<$A>	<#\>Why didn't you remember that yesterday Mr
<$D>	<#\>No I I I object to that ah 
<#\>Yesterday the witness did say something about the need to 
check on  <{><[>when </[> he got his
<$C>	<#\><[>He did </[></{> <#\>He said he was going to think 
about it and check it
<$A>	<#\>Right I'll I'll withdraw the 
question 
<#\>I withdraw the question <#\>I withdraw the question 
<#\>W well well actually Mr Commissioner 
perhaps I
<$D>	<#\>Oh you you can ask the questions 
about this <#\>You can question him on this but  <{><[>I'm not  going to </[>
<$A>	<#\><[>yeah yeah <#\>I I take my  friend's point </[></{> <#\>I I I'm 
prepared to concede that <#\>Well just bearing in mind that you 
said that you needed to check um your your 
memory of the relevant Christmas party by relationship with 
some 
important event why wasn't why weren't you 
able to do that before you gave evidence yesterday?
<$B>	<#\>I didn't know a chap like you'd be sitting there asking 
questions like this
<$A>	<#\>What? <#\>You didn't think that you'd be asked to 
remember precisely which Christmas party it was??
<$B>	<#\>Oh well that's true yeah
<$A>	<#\>Did you think Mr <@>surname1</@> that you could come 
along to this inquiry and make a serious allegation against a 
person of good reputation and simply get away with saying oh it 
had happened at a Christmas party one or two or three or four 
years ago?
<$B>	<#\>You've gotta give me a bit of benefit <#\>This is my 
first inquiry I've ever sat in on so I'm a bit strange to this 
whole routine
<$A>	<#\>Well you're no you're no stranger 
to courts are you?
<$B>	<#\>No
<$A>	<#\>That's correct isn't it?
<$B>	<#\>This year <#\>Yes I was last year but this year it's ah 
something different
<$A>	<#\>Oh I see <#\>A new experience in nineteen ninety-one 
<#\>Is that right
<$B>	<#\>That's right <,,>
<$A>	<#\>I see um <O>clearing throat</O> <,,> so um 
 so your answer to the question that I asked you just 
a moment ago about why you didn't ah consider the question of 
which Christmas party it was is simply because you didn't expect 
to be asked questions about it <#\>Is  <{><[>that right </[>?
<$B>	<#\><[>That's right </[></{> yes <,,>
<$A>	<#\>Why was that?
<$B>	<#\><,,>Well <,> it's just that's the 
way it is <#\>I just you know I never 
realised it'd be so in depth inquiry 
<#\>It's it's just the way you conduct your 
business <#\>It's something new to me as I said
<$A>	<#\>Mr Mr <@>surname1</@> you've given 
two statements to  <{1><[1>ICAC </[1> in the last um 
 within the last twelve months <#\> <{2><[2>That's 
right </[2>
<$B>	<#\><[1>yeah </[1></{1>
	<#\><[2>yeah </[2></{2>
<$A>	<#\>You've been here on two days prior to today ?
<$B>	<#\>Mmhmm
<$A>	<#\>You sat in this inquiry on Tuesday and saw a number of 
<#\>Oh I'll withdraw that <#\>You saw two witnesses give 
evidence <#\>Is that right?
<$B>	<#\>Oh one yeah
<$A>	<#\>I'm sorry <#\>Mr <@>surname4</@> <#\>You saw Mr 
<@>surname4</@> examined all day
<$B>	<#\><O>cough</O> That's right
<$A>	<#\>Is that right?
<$B>	<#\>Yep
<$A>	<#\>And asked many many questions?
<$B>	<#\>Yep
<$A>	<#\>And then you were here yesterday before you gave 
evidence <#\>That's correct?  <{1><[1><,> </[1> <#\>And you saw 
Councillor <@>surname5</@> give evidence <#\><{2><[2>That's 
correct</[2>? <#\>You saw Mr <@>surname3</@> give evidence 
<{3><[3><,,></[3> <#\>And you didn't think before you gave 
evidence yourself that there would be an in depth inquiry into 
the detail of the allegation that you were going to make about 
Mr <@>surname2</@> ?
<$B>	<#\><[1>mmhmm </[1></{1>
	<#\><[2>mmhmm</[2></{2>
	<#\><[3>mmhmm</[3></{3>
	<#\>That's right
<$A>	<#\>You thought you could just get away with simply 
<,>saying that it was some Christmas party in nineteen 
eighty-seven or nineteen eighty-eight or even nineteen 
eighty-six <#\>Is that right?
<$D>	<#\>I object to ah cross-examination <#\>The witness is 
being criticised apparently for after he's tested at some ah 
length going home and checking it out
<$A>	<#\>No I'm not criticising him with respect 
<#\> <{><[>That's not the question </[>
<$D>	<#\><[>What what  </[></{> what 
possible value can this ah continual ah cross-examination have?
<$C>	<#\>Just let me remind you both of what was said at page 
five forty five of the transcript um <#\>The witness said at 
five forty five point six <quote><#\>You're asking the memory 
again <#\>I'd have to go back through and see what trucks I had 
at the time because I've changed trucks mid-step halfway 
through</quote> <#\>Ah Mr <@>surname6</@> said <quote>well 
perhaps you can</quote> <#\>Then Mr <@>surname6</@> said 
<quote>I'm sorry no keep thinking <#\>I apologise</quote> 
<#\>Then the witness again said <quote>I have to see when the 
Geneva bridge job was started<#\>It was before the Geneva bridge 
job started <#\>I'd say it could have been nineteen 
eighty-seven</quote> <#\>Now have you thought about that matter 
over night Mr <@>surname1</@> ?
<$B>	<#\>Yes
<$C>	<#\>And what is it about the question of trucks that you 
rely upon or take into account in trying to place the date?
<$B>	<#\>Yeah well the year of eighty-eight I ah I 
ah disposed of one truck and I I 
obtained another truck and that was the year I started ah this 
particular work with the shire and I'd had quite a good year and 
ah that was the year of the Christmas party in eighty-eight
<$C>	<#\>The year you changed trucks?
<$B>	<#\>Yeah
<$C>	<#\>And did you look at any pieces of paper ah at home last 
night just to check when it was you changed trucks?
<$B>	<#\><O>clears throat</O> Yeah I went through my diary and 
it was in eighty-eight <#\>Um I changed trucks in ah February 
March and ah we started with a different truck on the job at 
<@>placename2</@> 
<$C>	<#\>Yes Mr <@>surname6</@>

<$B>	<#\><[>Yes alright I have yes </[></{>
<$A>	<#\>Excuse me Mr <@>Surname1</@> I didn't ask you whether 
your insurance documentation was current <#\>I was specifically 
asking you questions about the endorsement to cover you against 
liability for damage to council property or to indemnify the 
council against loss <#\>Do you remember that? <#\>Did you check 
that matter?
<$B>	<#\>Yep
<$A>	<#\>And what's what was your policy in 
July nineteen ah eighty-nine in relation to that?
<$B>	<#\>It's in front of you <#\>If you've got that information 
on my tender it's in front of you <#\>The policy number is there
<$A>	<#\>No no please that wasn't my question Mr <@>surname1</@> 
yesterday <#\>I asked you whether your policy in July nineteen 
eighty-nine as then current indemnified <@>placename1</@> shire 
council against loss <#\>Have you checked that fact?
<$B>	<#\>Yes
<$A>	<#\>Is that what you're policy er did in July nineteen 
eighty-nine?

 <$B><#\>If I had it here yes
<$A>	<#\>You were asked by me yesterday if you could bring it 
along today
<$B>	<#\>I'm sorry <,,>
<$A>	<#\>Anyway let's get back to ah your recollection of 
this ah this Christmas party and ah the way 
in which it's er it's er come before this 
Commission <#\>Now ah you told ah you told 
me ah just a while ago that you remember now that you approached 
<@>fullname3</@> about this matter in um nineteen ninety <#\>Is

something else
<$B> <#\>He didn't I did not approach him 
<#\>He approached me
<$A> <#\>Excuse me <#\>Well perhaps I'll put the question in 
another form <#\>Your evidence was yesterday, as I understood 
it, that you were talking to <@>fullname3</@> at his office 
<#\>Is that correct?
<$B> <#\>Yes
<$A> <#\>About some other matter <{><[>concerning</[> some ah 
some arrangement that you then had with the council to do some 
work <#\>Is that right?
<$B> <#\><[>That's right</[> </{>
	<#\>That's right
<$A> <#\>And in the course of talking to him about that other 
matter you raised this issue with him <#\>Is that right? <#\>Is 
this y what Mr <@>surname2</@> allegedly said to you at the bowling?
<$B> <#\>That's right
<$A> <#\>Um Now I'll come to what you just said a moment ago 
<#\>I just want to deal with the the time at 
which this occurred <#\>When do you say in nineteen ninety that 
you spoke to Mr <@>surname3</@> about this matter</I>
